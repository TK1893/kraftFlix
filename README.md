# Web application "kraftFlix"

## App description

This is the origin for the development of my web application "kraftFlix". The app will provide users with access to information on various films, directors and genres. Users will be able to log in, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.

- Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)
- Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites
- Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
- Allow existing users to deregister
- Allow users to see which actors star in which movies
- Allow users to view information about different actors
- Allow users to view more information about different movies, such as the release date and the movie rating

## Used Technologies / Tech Stack

In the current development phase, the server-side component of the application is being created - a Rest API. This will interact with a database in which data on various films is stored.
